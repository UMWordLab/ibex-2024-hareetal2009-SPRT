    <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In the experiment, you are going to be reading each sentence as a series of word "chunks". To do this, the experiment will only show one part of the sentence at a time. When a sentence first appears, it will look like a series of dashes, like this:
    </p>
    <p>
    ___ _____ ____ __________
    </p>
    <p>
    To read the sentence, you will press the <b>spacebar</b>. Pressing the spacebar will cause the current word to disappear, and will reveal the next word of the sentence. So when you press the spacebar for the first time, the display changes to look something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
    <u>The</u> 
    </p>
    And when you press it again, that first word disappears to reveal the next word of the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>silver</u>
    </p>
    Continue hitting the spacebar all the way through to the end of the sentence, revealing sentence word by word so that you are reading at a pace that allows you to read and understand the sentence. </p>

    <p>After some sentences, you will be asked to answer a comprehension question, to check how you interpreted the sentence. In some cases there is a correct answer, but you will not receive feedback on your accuracy after the practice items. <b>You should read the sentences as fast as you can while still being able to accurately answer most of these questions.</b> You do not need to get all of the answers correct, but if your accuracy is very low, this will be considered an indication of inattentive completion. </p>
    
    <p>Please do not stop when you are in the middle of a sentence. There are several break screens included for you to quickly stretch or look away from the screen. </p>

    <p>
    <b>Note: Please read each sentence silently to yourself. Do not read out loud!</b>
    </p>
