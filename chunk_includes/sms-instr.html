    <p>
        This experiment requires your <b>full attention</b> and must be completed in one session. 
        <b>It is important to read the words carefully</b> - move through the sentences as fast as you can while still understanding the sentence. 
        It is common to make occasional mistakes, but participant data that show persistent lack of attention may be rejected.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In this experiment you will read words from English sentences, one word at a time, and decide whether the new word fits with the previous words of the sentence.
        During the trials, you should rest your hands on the keyboard with a finger on the <b>F</b> and <b>J</b> keys.
        Press the <b>F</b> if the word fits in the sentence, and press the <b>J</b> key if it does not fit in the sentence when presented with a screen like the following:

        After each sentence, there will be a two second loading period for the next sentence.

        There will be several practice trials to get used to the experiment design before the main experiment begins.
